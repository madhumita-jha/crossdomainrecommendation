# ðŸŽ¯ Cross-Domain Recommendation Using Transfer Learning

This project is a **Cross-Domain Recommendation System** built using **Transfer Learning**, designed to recommend **books** and **music** based on a user's favorite **movie**. It intelligently transfers knowledge from the source domain (movies) to the target domains (books and music) to overcome data sparsity and improve recommendation quality.
